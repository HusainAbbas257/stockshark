# Stockshark ♟️
A step-by-step **educational chess engine project** written in Python. Inspired by **Stockfish**, but built from scratch to learn **search algorithms, evaluation, and engine architecture, etc**.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal
Stockshark's mission is simple: **learn chess engine development by actually building one**, and at the end defeat atleast myself (it already defeated me now i want to make it as strong as i can).

---

## ✅ Why this project exists
- To understand how real chess engines think
- To master algorithms
- To improve Python + problem solving skills
- To have a chess player thaat is perfectly matching my level
---

## 🧠 Current Capabilities (MVP Stage)
- ✅ Legal move generation
- ✅ Basic evaluation 
- ✅ Interactive play
- ✅ Move Ordering
- ✅ Opening book
- ✅Transposition Table
- 🔲 UCI support
- 🔲 Time management
- 🔲 Quiescence Search
