# Stockshark ♟️
A step-by-step **educational chess engine project** written in Python. Inspired by **Stockfish**, but built from scratch to learn **search algorithms, evaluation, and engine architecture, etc**.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal
Stockshark's mission is simple: **learn chess engine development by actually building one**, and at the end defeat atleast myself.

---

## ✅ Why this project exists
- To understand how real chess engines think
- To master algorithms
- To improve Python + problem solving skills
- To have a chess player thaat is perfectly matching my level
---

## 🧠 Current Capabilities (MVP Stage)
- 🔲 Legal move generation
- 🔲 Basic evaluation 
- 🔲 Interactive play
- 🔲 UCI support
- 🔲 Opening book
- 🔲 Time management
- 🔲 Transposition Table
- 🔲 Move Ordering
- 🔲 Quiescence Search
